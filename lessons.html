                          In this session, we understood what it is to be an academic. 
                          What is the goal of being an academic and what is the path we 
                          should take to reach there? <br>Some of the main things covered in 
                          this session were:<br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>The responsibilities of an academic</li>
                            <li>Academic promotions scheme</li>
                            <li>Criteria requirements for promotion e.g. research, teaching, institutional development</li>
                          </ul>
                          <br>
                          The highest position that one could achieve:<br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Academically would be an Emeritus Professor.
                            </li>
                            <li>Administratively would-be a Vice Chancellor</li>
                          </ul>
                          <br>
                          The highest qualifications attainable by academia are:<br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>PhD – Doctor of Philosophy</li>

                        In this session, we understood how to manage a classroom. The topics covered were:
                        <ul>
                          <li>How to manage a class</li>
                          <li>Three factors related to effective classroom management</li>
                          <li>Factors that influence our teaching</li>
                          <li>SWOT analysis of a classroom</li>
                          <li>Personal and Professional skills required to be an ideal academic</li>
                          <li>Outputs and Outcomes</li>
                          <li>Head, Heart, Hands, and Health</li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                        The four quadrants were extremely important and Prof asked us to assess ourselves 
                        every week how well we have achieved them for an idea self-assessment.<br><br>

                      <p>The meerkat or suricate (Suricata suricatta) is a small carnivoran belonging to the mongoose family (Herpestidae). It is the only member of the genus Suricata. Meerkats live in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much
                        of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a "mob", "gang" or "clan". A meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats, but some super-families have 50 or more members.
                        In captivity, meerkats have an average life span of 12–14 years, and about half this in the wild.</p>
