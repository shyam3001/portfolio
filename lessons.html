                          In this session, we understood what it is to be an academic.
                          What is the goal of being an academic and what is the path we
                          should take to reach there? <br>Some of the main things covered in
                          this session were:<br>
                        <ul>

                        The four quadrants were extremely important and Prof asked us to assess ourselves
                        every week how well we have achieved them for an idea self-assessment.<br><br>

                          In this session we learnt how to properly develop the required elements
                          of a new degree program. This was especially useful for me as I had to develop a
                          new degree curriculum (with a team) in the following week – MSc in Artificial
                          Intelligence and Machine Learning – for which I was able to directly apply this
                          knowledge. Not a week later, I had to create these for the above
                          MSc and present them at the Faculty of Computing Board Meeting.<br><br>
                          <b>What did I learn?</b>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Outcome based education</li>
                          <li>Graduate Attributes</li>
                          <li>Graduate Profile</li>
                          <li>Program Intended Learning Outcomes (PILO)</li>
                          <li>Module Intended Learning Outcomes (MILO)</li>
                          <li>Bloom’s Taxonomy </li>
                          <li>Developing a new degree program</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        We are asked what the attributes of a SLIIT graduate are: <br><br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Information Literacy</li>
                          <li>Communication</li>
                          <li>Personal and Intellectual Autonomy</li>
                          <li>Ethical, Social, and Professional Understanding</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><img src="images/lessons/slitgr.png" class="center"><br><br>
                        The graduate attributes of the SLIIT graduate must match with the vision and mission of
                        the university. We were shown some examples from other universities as well. <br><br>
                        <b>Blooms Taxonomy</b><br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Remember</li>
                          <li>Understand</li>
                          <li>Apply</li>
                          <li>Analyse</li>
                          <li>Evaluate</li>
                          <li>Create</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        By carefully applying Blooms Taxonomy to Learning Outcomes, we can carefully design, deliver,
                        and assess the required knowledge, skills, and attitudes. <br><br>

                        Outcome Based Education (OBE) is when the whole educational system is designed,
                        not on what is taught, but rather what learners
                        acquire and demonstrate at the end of the learning experience. <br>

                        <h4>What is a Curriculum?</h4>
                        Curriculum is a standards-based sequence of planned experiences where
                        students practice and achieve proficiency in content and applied learning skills.
                        Curriculum is the central guide for all educators as to what is essential for teaching
                        and learning, so that every student has access to rigorous academic experiences.

                          In this session, we understood what definition of a good teacher is and how we may become one.

                        and motivate learners. Good teachers are strong communicators, listen well,
                        encourage collaboration, adapt, engage, have patience, have empathy towards their students,
                        share best practices, and moreover are lifelong learners themselves and value real world

                          In this session we covered some of the most vital teaching and learning methods that benefit
                          our career.
                          <br><br><b>Motivation</b>
                          We started with motivation. This is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains
                          goal-oriented behavior. Education is known to be a dis-utility function (Prof Udith, 2020)
                          therefore we have to motivate students to continue their learning.<br>

                          Intrinsic motivation comes from within, which drives the person to do more and better – the
                          outcome is pure personal satisfaction. Extrinsic motivation comes from external factors for
                          example a workplace setting key performance indicators for employees that result in
                          promotions, increments and awards. <br><br>
                          Knowing what motivates students (or people) can have benefits such as:

                        <ul>

                          <li>Help improve people’s enthusiasm and productivity</li>

                          <li>Remove addictions and encourage healthy practices</li>

                          <li>Empowerment of individuals to be in control of their lives and goals</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        Motivations for students:

                        <ul>

                          <li>Behavior of the teacher – Prof Udith very much stressed this point</li>

                          <li>Structure of the course</li>

                          <li>How the students are assessed</li>

                          <li>Information interactions outside the class – Prof Colin added “small talk” here</li>

                          <li>Teaching style, techniques, and tools</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        <b>Teaching Domains</b>

                        <ul>

                          <li>Cognitive Domain – Knowledge</li>

                          <li>Psychomotor Domain – Skills </li>

                          <li>Affective Domain – Attitudes </li>

                          This was an extension from the previous weeks program, adding details and enhancing the
                          understanding of concepts learnt before. We covered things like types of training, more detail
                          on Bloom’s Taxonomy, Visual Learning methods, Teacher Centered vs Student Centered Learning,
                          Cone of Learning, and Resources.<br><br>

                          We were asked what is training, that is:

                        <ul>

                          <li>The process of gaining new skills, new knowledge, and attitudes</li>

                          <li>This is also sharpening our existing skills, attitudes, and knowledge</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        It is vital that all academic staff get training on important aspects, especially to SLIIT, such
                        as:

                        <ul>

                          <li>Counselling</li>

                          <li>Self-management e.g., time management, prioritizing, etc.</li>

                          <li>Teaching different skills to students</li>

                          <li>Handling large classes</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        We were asked to compare what we like and dislike in the qualities of 1st and 2nd year students,
                        vs 3rd and 4th year students. I personally found that I like teaching 3rd and 4th year students
                        because they have a drive to complete things and are more mature/professional as they have
                        completed industrial training. However, they are less participative and energetic and 1st and
                        2nd years.<br><br>

                        Prof Chalinda mentioned several ways we can teach in our classroom. And we can apply them (with
                        careful planning) to any class size.

                        <ul>

                          <li>Lecturing – direct classroom delivery</li>

                          <li>Discussion groups</li>

                          <li>Live demonstration</li>

                          <li>In class activities – e.g., brainstorming, debates, etc.</li>

                          <li>Role playing</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        We also deeply discussed teacher centered learning vs student centered learning, and the 4
                        quadrants, where the teacher is either a Director, Leading Learner, Nurturer, and Facilitator.
                        We compared the pros and cons of each approach and how should it be used best for different
                        audiences.<br>

                        We also looked at teaching resources e.g., Whiteboards, Handouts, Specimens, Models, Book /
                        Journals / Newspapers, Posters & Banners, Video Material, PowerPoint, and Interactive Smart
                        Boards.<br><br>

                          In this session we learnt mainly about Aims, Objectives, Goals, and ILOs. This felt like a
                          little overlapping with the previous session by Dr Pallegama, still, Prof Chalinda was able to
                          make it very interesting for us.<br><br>

                          The first learning item was how to set SMART Objectives

                        <ul>

                          <li> (S)pecific </li>

                          <li> (M)easurable </li>

                          <li> (A)chievable </li>

                          <li> (R)ealistic </li>

                          <li> (T)imely </li>

                        </ul><br>

                        Also, objectives can be outcome based or process based. This is the typical argument of whether
                        you would focus on the destination vs journey, or prize vs game. <br>

                        Finally we learnt about the three domains and their comparisons<br><br>

                          This lesson was about creating a sample course outline for a module we plan to teach during
                          our university career. The things that need to address were:

                        <ul>

                          <li>Course Title</li>

                          In this session we learnt the valuable art of assessment and evaluation. This I believe is one
                          of the most important sections in the entire staff development program, because it is also one
                          of the aspects, we struggle the most in our teaching semester at SLIIT. I feel that we at
                          SLIIT still have a lot left to perfect the best assessment methodologies for our
                          students<br><br>

                          What did we cover:

                        <ul>

                          <li>Types of Assessments</li>

                          <li>Assessment Components</li>

                          <li>Assessment Cycle</li>

                          <li>Types of Evaluation</li>

                          <li>Feedback</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        We identified two types of assessments in an education system

                        <ul>

                          <li>Formative Assessment – to give student feedback to improve</li>

                          <li>Summative Assessment – assess against benchmarking criteria</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        Then what is evaluation? And how does it differ from assessment?<br>
                        <br><I>“Evaluation focuses on grades and might reflect classroom components other than course
                          content and mastery level. An evaluation can be used as a final review to gauge the quality of
                          instruction. It is product oriented. This means that the main question is: “What’s been
                          learned?” In short, evaluation is judgmental.”</i><br><br>

                        Evaluation is also formative and summative. To get the best outcomes, we need to use assignments
                        and evaluations both in combination.<br>

                        Finally, we discussed about Feedback. To be effective, it was discussed in detail that feedback
                        needs to be aligning with the goals, tangible, transparent, actionable, user-friendly, timely,
                        ongoing and consistent.

                          In this session we learnt how to do an effective PowerPoint presentation with certain
                          scientific design decisions backed up by scientific facts. <br>

                          First, we identified different types of presentations.

                        <ul>

                          <li>Informative</li>

                          <li>Persuasive </li>

                          <li>Instructional </li>

                          <li>Arousing </li>

                          <li>Decision Making </li>

                        </ul><br>

                        Then we learnt about tips for making effective PowerPoint presentations. Prior to the session we
                        thought we knew how to do effective PPT’s but there were quite a few learning points!

                        <ol>

                          <li>Keeping it simple </li>

                          <li> Reduce text and use images </li>

                          <li> Use transitions and animations sparingly </li>

                          <li> Use high resolution graphics </li>

                          <li> Its good to have a theme, but try and avoid the built in PowerPoint templates </li>

                          <li> Use charts and graphs where applicable </li>

                          <li> Smart use of color </li>

                          <li> Fonts – use a Sans Serif font for presentations and on-screen content </li>

                          <li> Use audio and video </li>

                          <li> Use the slide sorter to have the optimal order of slides </li>

                        </ol><br>

                        There is a golden rule of THREE.

                        <ul>

                          <li>Give a compelling structure to your presentation </li>

                          <li>Keep it simple </li>

                          Since our promotion is based on research performance, this session was of special interest to
                          us and exceptionally valuable for our career growth. We learnt several valuable aspects here
                          such as:

                        <ul>

                          <li>What is a research project?</li>

                          <li>What is the research process?</li>

                          <li>How to write a successful research paper?</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        A research project is a project that follows a scientific method to answer a research question.
                        A research question, on the other hand, is a recursive definition of the previous – as in, a
                        question that needs doing research to be answered!<br><br>

                        Research studies can be case studies, controlled studies, sample studies, randomized trials,
                        surveys, and secondary data analyses.<br><br>

                        So how does one go through the research process?

                        <ul>

                          <li>First develop a good research topic, this maybe an iterative process</li>

                          <li>Find the relevant information e.g., scientific publications, books, journals, newspapers,
                            websites, datasets, etc.</li>

                          <li>Evaluate your information e.g., a systematic literature review</li>

                          <li>Write the research paper explaining your methodology and analyzing your results </li>

                          <li>Cite your references</li>

                        </ul><br>

                        This also leads to the basic anatomy or structure of a research paper

                        <ul>

                          <li>Abstract</li>

                          <li>Introduction </li>

                          In this section we learnt about this very exercise we are doing right now – namely how to
                          manage your own portfolio. A portfolio is a collation of materials that consolidates your
                          qualifications, skills, experiences, education, and training into a single compilation of
                          materials. It provides a direct insight into your beliefs, personality, and work
                          ethics.<br><br>

                          Different Types of Portfolio

                        <ul>

                          <li>Personal portfolio</li>

                          <li> Dossier portfolio </li>

                          <li> Reflective portfolio </li>

                          <li> Employment portfolio </li>

                          <li> Assessment portfolio </li>

                        </ul><br>

                        Portfolio Formats:

                        <ul>

                          <li> Digital – PowerPoint, Word, etc. </li>

                          <li> Web – Websites, Blogs, Online Profiles e.g., LinkedIn </li>

                          <li> Hard-copy – Folder </li>

                        </ul><br>

                        For this exercise, as it is visible, I have chosen to do a reflective portfolio using a website.
                        But what should go on it? As it is visible from this website, I decided on the following

                          Resource Person: Prof. Nimal Rajapaksha<br><br>
                          This was also a very important session to us, which was delivered by our own Deputy Vice
                          Chancellor Prof Nimal Rajapaksha. This session was vital for our career development,
                          promotions and understanding how we can develop our research profile.<br><br>

                          First, we looked what types of researchers are there:

                        <ul>

                          <li>PhD Student </li>

                          <li> Post-Doctoral Research Associate / Assistant </li>

                          <li> Post-Doctoral Research Fellow </li>

                          <li> Academic – Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader, Professor </li>

                        </ul><br>

                        The role of an academic involves primarily doing research, but also carrying out teaching and
                        administrative duties in universities. On the other hand, you find many who are employed
                        primarily as teaching staff also carrying out research. <br><br>

                        Then, we looked at the responsibilities of an academic researcher:

                        <ul>

                          <li> Carry out original, high-level individual and collaborative research with other team
                            members </li>

                          <li> Organize your own time and budget effectively, including for off-site and overseas visits
                          </li>

                          <li> Prepare and deliver presentations at national and international conferences to large
                            audiences </li>

                          <li> Prepare and write high quality papers for submission to peer-reviewed journals and
                            conference proceedings </li>

                          <li> Participate in group meetings with other researchers and support staff </li>

                          <li> Apply for sources of external funding in addition to that provided by your employer </li>

                          <li> Teach undergraduate and postgraduate students </li>

                          <li> Comply with all health and safety and ethics requirements for research activities </li>

                          <li> Plan and develop future research objectives and proposals </li>

                          <li> Supervise students undertaking masters and PhD level projects. </li>

                        </ul><br>

                        This requires an academic to possess certain skills to carry about the above duties and
                        responsibilities.

                        <ul>

                          <li>Intellectual ability</li>

                          <li>Technical aptitude</li>

                          <li>Organization skills </li>

                          <li>Interpersonal skills </li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
